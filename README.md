# Vanilla Material Builder

This is used to generate the `VanillaMaterial.java` file for the Cotton API.

## Data origins

We download the I18n by using [InventivetalentDev's MC Assets service](https://mcasset.cloud/). The data gets downloaded
from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/InventivetalenDev/minecraft-assets/).

## Usage

Using this is as easy as installing all requirements from the `requirements.txt` and running the `main.py` file. It is
created with Python 1.12. You can change individual settings in the `configuration.json` file. If you have further
questions, don't be scared to ask them! I'm happy to help you :]
